<p> I am a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://hotmart.com/en">Hotmart</a> empowering our Data Scientists by building a complete AI Platform.</p>

<p> I previously worked as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.erathos.com/">Erathos</a> where I built an ML model from scratch that enhanced our customers prediction accuracy by 300%, by rethinking the business problem and engineering a completely new approach.</p>

<p> I have also <a href="downloads/sucess-story-ifood.pdf" target="_blank">succeeded</a> in applying Machine Learning for AML Prevention at <a href="https://institucional.ifood.com.br/en/">iFood</a>.</p>

<p> And before that I was at <a href="https://www.ebanx.com/en/">EBANX</a> where my data-centered approach to financial modeling helped close a multi-million dollar incentive from a global payment processing network.</p>
